            <h2>A Brief History</h2>

            <p>
              Kenpo is a term describing one of the most innovative systems of
              the Martial Arts and is practiced both in America and worldwide.
              "Ken", meaning law, and "Po", meaning fist, combine to become
              Kenpo or "law of the fist". <br />
              <br />
              Kenpo, known for its explosive speed and power, is a mixture of
              soft and hard movements, giving you the ultimate benefit of
              adapting to any given situation. It is based off of natural
              motionâ€”motion that you use in your everyday life making it very
              easy to be successful in self-defense. In short, no matter what
              height, weight, or body dimensions a person may have the art is
              fit to the individual, which is something few martial arts can
              claim. The system adapts to the student creating great fighters
              who are highly skilled in self-defense, and itâ€™s difficult to
              imagine a martial art that could offer more. <br />
              <br />
              Elwood's Kenpo and Self-defense is one such discipline which has
              evolved. It is a powerful and fast, hard hitting style of fighting
              which was established for the more serious Kenpoist. It's a
              combination of Kenpo and various other martial arts along with
              street fighting and has been referred to as Elwood's Street Smart
              Martial Art. It also teaches an awareness and knowledge of
              survival skills on the streets which makes Elwood's Kenpo and
              Self-defense the modern-day martial art.
              <br />
              <br />
              The main focus of Elwoodâ€™s Kenpo is self-defense, particularly in
              street fighting. This martial art applies logic and practicality
              to effective, powerful movements and is mainly categorized by
              strikes performed by the entire body. Kenpo uses physical
              coordination and continuity combined with linear and circular
              motions to perform powerful strikes and defenses designed to
              disable an attacker as quickly as possible. <br />
              <br />
              This martial art is divided into four sections, the basics, forms,
              self-defense, and sparring. Students of Kenpo work their way
              through these sections, beginning with the basics, up to sparring.
              <br />

              <br />
              Earning a black belt in Kenpo takes years to achieve. Kenpo is
              highly effective in the hands of a master and is an ideal
              self-defense to study for those interested in Kenpo.
