            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>
              Kenpo is a term describing one of the most innovative systems of
              the Martial Arts and is practiced both in America and worldwide.
              "Ken", meaning law, and "Po", meaning fist, combine to become
              Kenpo or "law of the fist". <br />
              <br />
              In 1954 Ed Parker opened his first commercial Kenpo studio in the
              United States. This pioneering effort made him the undisputed
              father of American Kenpo Karate. As America's foremost karate
              instructor, he was never satisfied with patented answers. Although
              he believed that tradition could be helpful, he placed emphasis on
              logic over tradition.<br />
              <br />

              He approved of the methods he was learning as a student in Kenpo
              but having been an experienced street fighter he felt that
              innovations were needed. Accordingly, his method of relating past
              experiences with functional aspects of Kenpo have revealed some
              astounding breakthroughs. <br />
              <br />
              Through 40 years of experience, he built his system on principles
              of motion that included “Opposite and Reverse Motion”, Tailoring”,
              “Focus” and the use of Logic. Ed Parker’s system incorporates
              linear and circular motion, with intermittent spurts of speed and
              power when and where necessary, with both major and minor moves.
              His idea was to learn motion and principles and then tailor it to
              fit each individual. <br />
              <br />

              Kenpo, known for its explosive speed and power, is a mixture of
              soft and hard movements, giving you the ultimate benefit of
              adapting to any given situation. It is based off of natural
              motion—motion that you use in your everyday life making it very
              easy to be successful in self-defense. In short, no matter what
              height, weight, or body dimensions a person may have the art is
              fit to the individual, which is something few martial arts can
              claim. The system adapts to the student creating great fighters
              who are highly skilled in self-defense, and it’s difficult to
              imagine a martial art that could offer more. <br />
              <br />
              Elwood's Kenpo Karate is one such discipline which has evolved. It
              is a powerful and fast, hard hitting style of fighting which was
              established for the more serious Kenpoist. It's a combination of
              American Kenpo and various other martial arts along with street
              fighting and has been referred to as Elwood's Street Smart Martial
              Art. It also teaches an awareness and knowledge of survival skills
              on the streets which makes Elwood's Kenpo the modern-day martial
              art.
