            Barry Elwood grew up in Los Angeles where self-defense was crucial
            due to widespread gang activity. Even as a young man, in order to
            survive these violent surroundings, he started training in boxing
            and martial arts. Mr. Elwood started training in Kenpo Karate in
            1967 in Pasadena, California and was one of the early students
            taught by 7th Degree Black Belt, Sr. Professor

            , the founder of American Kenpo Karate.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mr. Elwood received his black belt on April 12, 1975 in Pasadena,
            California at Ed Parker’s Original Kenpo Karate Studio and has been
            involved in Kenpo and other styles of martial arts for over 40 plus
            years. He has participated in all aspects of the Arts including
            Boxing, Karate, Wrestling, Muay Thai, Weapons, Forms, Full Combat
            Tactics and holds numerous honors in the martial art world. <br />
            <br />
            From this he has established himself as a highly respected Kenpoist
            and teacher of this art today. In the year 2000 Elwood’s Kenpo and
            Self-Defense was established in Reno, Nevada. At that time Sensei
            Elwood had bestowed upon him by his peers the rank of 10th degree
            “Grand Master” of his new Kenpo System. Today, Sensei Elwood
            continues to carry on the Kenpo legacy with the same high standard
            and belief that was taught to him in those small studios in Glendora
            & Pasadena California where it all began.
