          What is Self Defense? Self-defense is a set of skills and techniques
          that enable someone to successfully escape, resist, and/or survive
          violent attacks. A good self-defense course provides psychological
          awareness and verbal skills, not just physical training. The right of
          self-defense is the right for people to use reasonable force or
          defensive force, for the purpose of defending one's own life or the
          lives of others. Self-defense is for everyone and can be of great
          benefit when taught responsibly. Knowing how to defend yourself can
          boost your confidence, reduce anxiety and make you more aware of your
          surroundings. For more information contact us for a free personal
          assessment.
